Friend finder is a site that matches users based on compatibility after answering 10 survey questions.  Basic functionalities are as described in the homework_instructions.md. In addition, the result page not only displays the most compatible match, but also lists out your answers and their answers for side-by-side comparison.  In the case where multiple people tie for the most compatible, scrolling buttons will appear, allowing you to review all compatible candidates.  You can try this out if you run the schema.sql file, then leave all responses as default (3).

Another functionality is that a user can take the survey repeatedly.  If the user is taking the survey for the first time, their answers will be added to the db; otherwise, the user's new answers will overwrite their older answers in the db.
